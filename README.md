### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter&Dart
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other Flutter Devs.
- âš¡ Fun fact: really like reading fantastic novels and big fan of "Sherlock Holmes"

Hello there. I'm Ã–mer. I live in Turkey and work as a teacher here. In addition, since the idea of "being a programmer", which was my childhood dream, attracted me, I started to learn "Flutter". I have been interested in Flutter for about 6 months and I am improving myself in this area.
